## Overview

VoyagerAI is designed to provide users with seamless and interactive experiences using a chat interface. It leverages **Google Generative AI** to power the AI's responses and **MongoDB** to store the user chats and interactions. The application also features a login/signup mechanism powered by **Clerk** for secure user authentication.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Engage with the AI and receive dynamic, intelligent responses.
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user sessions with **Clerk**.
- **Chat History**: Save and retrieve past conversations with the AI.
- **Image Support**: Attach images to chats (powered by **ImageKit**).
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for use on desktop and mobile devices.
  
## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to handle API requests.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user chats and interaction history.
- **Clerk**: Authentication system to manage user sign-ins and sign-ups.
- **ImageKit**: Image upload and delivery service.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Navigation between different pages of the application.
- **TypeAnimation**: For smooth typing animations in the chat interface.

MongoDB Models
Chat Model
The Chat model stores the user's chat history, including the role of the sender (user or model) and the content of the conversation.

javascript
Copy code
const chatSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    userId: { type: String, required: true },
    history: [
      {
        role: { type: String, enum: ["user", "model"], required: true },
        parts: [{ text: { type: String, required: true } }],
        img: { type: String, required: false }
      }
    ]
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
UserChats Model
The UserChats model stores a list of chats for each user, along with the chat's title and creation timestamp.

javascript
Copy code
const userChatsSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    userId: { type: String, required: true },
    chats: [
      {
        _id: { type: String, required: true },
        title: { type: String, required: true },
        createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
      }
    ]
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
Frontend
Components
Homepage
The landing page of the application, featuring a dynamic chat animation with the bot and human, and a "Get Started" button to navigate to the dashboard.

DashboardPage
The main page where users can interact with the AI. The chat history is displayed, and new chats can be initiated.

SignInPage
A page that allows users to sign in to the application via Clerk.

SignUpPage
A page where users can sign up for an account.

Libraries Used
React: The primary library for building the user interface.
React Router: For routing between different pages in the application.
TypeAnimation: Provides smooth typing effects for simulating chat interactions.
@tanstack/react-query: For managing and caching API requests.
Authentication
User authentication is powered by Clerk. Users can sign up and sign in using the Clerk API, which is integrated into the frontend. Clerk handles user sessions securely.

Authentication Flow:
User signs up or logs in via Clerk.
The user is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard page.
API calls to the backend are authenticated using the Clerk JWT token.
